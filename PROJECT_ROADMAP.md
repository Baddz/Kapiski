### 3.2 Entities with Simple Relationships (e.g., MissionOption)
- [ ] Same steps as 3.1 for each entity

### 3.3 Complex Entities (e.g., Mission with inheritance)
- [ ] Same steps as 3.1 for each entity

### 3.4 Cross-cutting Entities (e.g., Player)
- [ ] Same steps as 3.1 for each entity

## 4. Missing Components & Enhancements
